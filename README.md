Repository for Quiz project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is my basic attempt at making an online quiz.  I hope to add more details in the future.
You must answer all of the questions correctly in the time limit to be added to the high score list.
Each time you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds is subtracted from your time limit.
You are able to view previous scores anytime as well as clear scores if need be.
